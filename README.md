# Commit Logger 📊

An automated framework that logs Git commits to Google Sheets with AI-powered explanations using OpenAI's GPT models. Triggered by GitHub Actions on every commit.

## Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Explanations**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to analyze and explain code changes
- 📋 **Google Sheets Integration**: Automatically logs commit data to a spreadsheet
- ⚡ **GitHub Actions Automation**: Triggers on every push/PR merge
- 🔐 **Secure Configuration**: Uses GitHub Secrets for API keys
- 📈 **Rich Commit Data**: Tracks author, files changed, lines added/deleted, and more

## Setup Guide

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd commit-logger
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy `env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys:

```bash
cp env.example .env
# or use the setup script
npm run setup
```

### 3. Set up Google Sheets API

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Sheets API
4. Create a Service Account:
   - Go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts"
   - Click "Create Service Account"
   - Download the JSON key file
5. Share your Google Sheet with the service account email
6. Copy the required values to your environment variables

### 4. Set up OpenAI API

1. Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Add it to your environment variables

### 5. Configure GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repository settings, add these secrets:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID`: Your Google Sheets ID (from the URL)
- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: Service account email
- `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key from service account JSON (include the full key with `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` headers)

### 6. Create Your Google Sheet

Create a new Google Sheet and note the ID from the URL:
```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SHEET_ID/edit
```

The sheet will automatically be set up with headers when the first commit is processed.

## Usage

Once configured, the system automatically:

1. **Triggers** on commits to main/master/develop branches
2. **Analyzes** the commit using GitHub API
3. **Explains** changes using OpenAI GPT-4
4. **Logs** everything to your Google Sheet

### Manual Testing

You can test the logger setup and connections:

```bash
# Set up your .env file first
npm run test-local
```

Or run the full commit logger (requires GitHub environment variables):

```bash
npm start
```

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. 🔄 **Real-time Collaboration Metrics**
**Enhancement**: Add team collaboration insights by tracking:
- Code reviewer assignments and response times
- Cross-team contributions and knowledge sharing
- Commit frequency patterns and developer productivity metrics
- Integration with Slack/Teams for real-time notifications

**Implementation**: Extend GitHub Service to fetch PR review data, add new sheet columns for collaboration metrics, and create webhook endpoints for real-time updates.

### 2. 🧪 **Automated Testing Integration**
**Enhancement**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to capture:
- Test coverage changes per commit
- Build success/failure rates
- Performance benchmarks and regression detection
- Automated quality gates and alerts

**Implementation**: Add CI service integration, extend workflow to capture test results, create performance tracking dashboard, and implement automated quality notifications.

### 3. 🎯 **Smart Code Quality Analysis**
**Enhancement**: Implement intelligent code quality scoring:
- Static analysis integration (ESLint, SonarQube)
- Technical debt tracking and trend analysis
- Code complexity metrics and maintainability scores
- Automated refactoring suggestions from AI

**Implementation**: Integrate static analysis tools, create quality scoring algorithms, add trend visualization, and enhance OpenAI prompts for refactoring suggestions.

### 4. 📊 **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**
**Enhancement**: Create a comprehensive analytics interface:
- Interactive charts for commit patterns and team velocity
- Predictive analytics for project timeline estimation
- Risk assessment based on code complexity and change frequency
- Custom reporting with exportable insights

**Implementation**: Build React/Vue dashboard, implement data visualization libraries, create predictive models, and add export functionality with scheduled reports.

### 5. 🔐 **Enhanced Security & Compliance**
**Enhancement**: Strengthen security and add compliance features:
- Automated security vulnerability scanning per commit
- Compliance tracking for regulatory requirements (SOX, GDPR)
- Audit trail with immutable logging
- Role-based access control for different data sensitivity levels

**Implementation**: Integrate security scanning tools, add compliance frameworks, implement blockchain-based audit trails, and create granular permission systems.

## Customization

### Changing the AI Model

Edit `src/services/openai-service.js` to use a different model:

```javascript
model: "gpt-3.5-turbo", // or "gpt-4-turbo", etc.
```

### Modifying Trigger Conditions

Edit `.github/workflows/commit-logger.yml` to change when the action runs:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop, feature/* ]  # Add more branches
```

### Adding More Data

Extend the `CommitLogger` class to capture additional metadata like:
- PR information
- Code review comments
- Build status
- Test coverage changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Spreadsheet not found"**: Ensure the service account has access to your sheet
2. **"OpenAI quota exceeded"**: Check your OpenAI billing and usage limits  
3. **"GitHub token permissions"**: Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` has repository read access

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by setting `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in your environment.
